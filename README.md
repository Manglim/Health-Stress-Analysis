# Health Stress Analysis 🧠📊

This notebook explores the relationship between stress and various health indicators using machine learning and data visualization techniques. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM to analyze stress levels. Ideal for anyone interested in health informatics, data science, or mental health analytics.

**Key Features:**
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on stress-related health data
- Visualizations with Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Machine learning models: DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, SVC
- Performance evaluation using classification reports and confusion matrices

📁 Dataset: Includes variables such as heart rate, BMI, sleep patterns, and more  
🧪 Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
🎯 Goal: Predict and understand stress levels based on physiological and behavioral metrics
